# 📊 End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis | SQL • Power BI • Python • Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

I built this **End-to-End Customer Churn Analysis** project as part of my data analytics and machine learning portfolio.
The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and predict potential churners using **SQL, Power BI dashboards, and a Random Forest Machine Learning model in Python**.

This project demonstrates my ability to work across the full analytics pipeline — from **data preparation and ETL** to **visual analytics** and **predictive modeling**.
